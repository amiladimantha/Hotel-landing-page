I created this landing page as an interview practical. However, instead of keeping it just with me, I decided to put it up here on GitHub as an open-source resource to help individuals to learn, adapt, and create their own small projects. Feel free to customize and modify the theme and components to suit your personal style and branding preferences.

## License and Attribution

This landing page is a compound version of many live websites and I have made a few tweaks here and there to avoid any copyright issues, but if you are going to use it please change the images as they are directly taken from those sites. Otherthan that the structure is mostly open to everyone to use.
